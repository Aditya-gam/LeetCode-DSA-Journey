# LeetCode DSA Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice repository! This repository contains the Python solutions to problems I solve on LeetCode as I work through various DSA concepts.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of solved problems for future reference and revision.
- A structured way to track progress and ensure consistency in DSA practice.
- A resource for others who find these solutions helpful.

## Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate file, organized in directories based on problem difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). The README will include a table to keep track of all solved problems with links to both the problem on LeetCode and the corresponding solution in this repository.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LeetCode-DSA-Journey.git
   ```
2. Navigate through the directories to explore solutions based on difficulty.
3. Refer to the table below for specific problems and solutions.
